		<h1>WHAT IS "EXOTIC EXPERIENCE?"</h1>
			<h2>Come meet the stars of the You Tube video sensation "Kangaroo and Lemur
			Play Tag!"</h2>
			<p>We also have Jeffery, the mini donkey, Sam the mini horse, some bunnies,
			tortoises and Gypsy Horses!</p><br />
			<p><strong>Scroll down to read the "Quick Facts" to find out just how rare
			these animals are and how special and amazing it is for you to be able to
			experience them.</strong></p><br /><br />
			<h3>DOZER</h3>
			<p>Dozer is a nine-year-old Lab/Beagle cross that loves <em>EVERYONE!</em>  He
			loves to be touched by <em>ANYONE</em> and <em>ANYTHING! He loves to play with
			our exotic animals!</em></p><br />
			<h3>K.C.</h3>
			<p>K.C. is an eight-year-old tortoise-shell female cat.  She <em>LOVES</em>
			kangaroo joeys and babysits them when they are in their pouches!</p><br />
			<h3>KEEVA</h3>
			<p>Keeva is a three-month-old Irish Wolfhound puppy--she is all puppy right
			now...and BIG!</p><br />
			<h3>LOLLI</h3>
			<p>Lolli is a two-year-old tri-colored female ruffed lemur.  She is super
			sweet and gentle--loves to play and have her belly and armpits scratched.
			<em><strong>NOTE TO GUESTS:</strong></em> Ruffed lemurs are critically
			endangered; and a black and white crossed with a red ruffed would not happen
			in the wild, making Lolli one of a kind and very unique. <em>Look for babies
			in the future!</em></p><br />
			<h3>LOVE BUG</h3>
			<p>Love Bug, a.k.a. "Bug," is a one-year-old male Western gray kangaroo who
			will play with anyone and anything put in front of him. He is a stickler on
			grooming and believes all the animals need a bit of that!  He is a sweetheart
			and loves to hug people and other animals.</p><br />
			<h3>LIAM</h3>
			<p>Liam is a three-year-old male ring-tailed lemur, a.k.a. "Boss."  He is my
			personal pet and sleeps in the house with me, though he feels it is his job to
			protect not only me, but the other animals, as well.  He loves them all and
			does NOT take kindly to other humans coming in to pet ANYONE!  Unfortunately,
			he will be caged during guest visits, though he is fun to watch in the
			videos.</p><br />
			<p>more to comeâ€¦</p>
