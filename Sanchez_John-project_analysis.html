			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<div id="category">
				<p>Define the goals for both the client company and the consumer/end-user for this site.</p>
					<ul>Client Goals:
						<li>To get visitors to "The most unique interaction with exotic animals in Orlando!!!"</li>
						<li>To highlight the animals that can be experienced hands-on</li>
						<li>To inform the visitor of the many ways to interact with the animals</li>
						<li>To get the visitor to view their youtube videos</li>
						<li>To raise funds for purchasing another exotic animal to add to their collection</li>
						<li>To sell t-shirts to help fund the experience</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>End-user Goals:
						<li>discover what makes the exotic experience exotic</li>
						<li>schedule a visit for a hands-on experience with atypical zoo animals</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>How well are those goals currently being met?
						<li>The site is saturated with large images of the animals</li>
							<dd>- This highlights them very well = goal met</dd>
						<li>The CTA's for booking visits, raising funds, and selling products are poorly represented with text that is styled like all the rest of the content.</li>
							<dd>- The imagery overpowers the text and scanning the pages content makes missing the CTA's easy = goal not efficiently accomplished</dd>
					</ul>
