		<h1>Project Analysis</h1>
			<p>Based on the research of John Sanchez for the site redesign of exoticexperience.net</p>
			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<h3>Define the goals for both the client company and the consumer/end-user for this site.</h3>
				<div id="category1">
					<p>Client Goals:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To get visitors to "The most unique interaction with exotic animals in Orlando!!!"</li>
						<li>To highlight the animals that can be experienced hands-on</li>
						<li>To inform the visitor of the many ways to interact with the animals</li>
						<li>To get the visitor to view their youtube videos</li>
						<li>To raise funds for purchasing another exotic animal to add to their collection</li>
						<li>To sell t-shirts to help fund the experience</li>
					</ul>
					<p>End-user Goals:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>discover what makes the exotic experience exotic</li>
						<li>schedule a visit for a hands-on experience with atypical zoo animals</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>How well are those goals currently being met?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The site is saturated with large images of the animals, this highlights them very well = goal met.</li>
						<li>The CTA's for booking visits, raising funds, and selling products are poorly represented with text that is styled like all the rest of the content. The imagery overpowers the text and scanning the pages content makes missing the CTA's easy = goal not efficiently accomplished.</li>
					</ul>
				
				<h3>Summarize what you understand to be the intent of the newly, redesigned site.<br>How will the previously identified goals be achieved?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>A redesign will address the inconsistent image sizes, the text styling, the layout, and highlight the CTA's better, most importantly, booking a visit. The intent is to give the site an exotic feel by incorporating subtle color tones playing down non-essential elements like a tiled background, organizing the many animal photographs into galleries that are separated from, but closely tied to, the rest of the content, use cartoony characters throughout the site to tie in the large header element and navigation, and draw more attention to the fundraising request.</li>
					</ul>

			<div id="category2">
				<p>sources: Alexa.com, mojopages.com, and yelp.com</p>

						<li>Estimated daily time on site, 3 month average = 10:11 (mm:ss)</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Competitor Three: Central Florida Zoo, centralfloridazoo.org</h3>

						<li>Estimated daily time on site, 3 month average = 4:22 (mm:ss)</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Are they drawing on a demographic you would like to tap into?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The demographic is very similar due to the fact that parents/guardians are the ones who would book a visit to the experience</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Are visitors spending more time in their site's pages than yours?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Two competitors are very large, statewide and nationwide known venues, the other is a smaller outfit that had sparse info available like the redesign project</li>
						<li>The larger sites' info portrayed the impression that they did receive more visitors who stayed longer than the smaller venue</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Are they using keywords that you should be targeting as well?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>the top keywords were specific to the respective sites and ones my site would use</li>
						<li>one area that seems unused is the "exotic animal" "petting zoo" combination, and we would like to incorporate this combination into drawing queries to our site</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Are there any bad practices that are holding back yourself or the competition that you can learn from?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Based on just the two search engines, yelp.com and mojo.com, my site isn't registered with them, this greatly limits my visibility and exposure</li>
						<li>Any site or query associated with the site or its owner presents no information so I am wondering if they advertise, or rather, how and where do they advertise.</li>
						<li>Concerning the competition, their sites look modern (I know we're not talking ancient history), consistently updated, and very user friendly - us, not so much!</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
			<div id="category3">
				<p>Provide at least two (2) Use Cases or Personas for the typical user that would visit this site. Describe their general usage and specify potential needs/workflows.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Persona One:</strong> Visitor lives locally. This is a mom, early 30's to mid 40's, of more than one child whose ages are between 4 and 16 yrs. old. She may not be a stay at home mom, but she tends to do most of her internet browsing while at home. As summer break is approaching she is considering options to get her children out of the house but wants to avoid the major theme parks and the beach due to the stress of managing the kids in heavily populated arenas. The family has visited petting zoos before and she wants to have an alternative to caged animals as well as small farm animals.</li>
						<li><strong>Persona Two:</strong> Visitor lives out of state. This is a married father who has promised a family (wife and four children, 6 to 14 yrs. old) vacation to Florida that may include a trip to big theme parks but will also include sight seeing and visiting lesser know, but very attractive areas of Orlando. He has a college degree and works in a field he studied in, but has a moderate vacation budget. He is looking for an unusual experience to share with acquaintances that will reflect a more unique trip to the Panhandle. Instead of showing up and seeing what is available he wants to book a visit to ensure the experience is part of their planning.</li>
