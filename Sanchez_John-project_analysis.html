			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<div id="category">
				<h3>Define the goals for both the client company and the consumer/end-user for this site.</h3>
					<ul>Client Goals:
						<li>To get visitors to "The most unique interaction with exotic animals in Orlando!!!"</li>
						<li>To highlight the animals that can be experienced hands-on</li>
						<li>To inform the visitor of the many ways to interact with the animals</li>
						<li>To get the visitor to view their youtube videos</li>
						<li>To raise funds for purchasing another exotic animal to add to their collection</li>
						<li>To sell t-shirts to help fund the experience</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>End-user Goals:
						<li>discover what makes the exotic experience exotic</li>
						<li>schedule a visit for a hands-on experience with atypical zoo animals</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>How well are those goals currently being met?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The site is saturated with large images of the animals</li>
							<dd>- This highlights them very well = goal met</dd>
						<li>The CTA's for booking visits, raising funds, and selling products are poorly represented with text that is styled like all the rest of the content.</li>
							<dd>- The imagery overpowers the text and scanning the pages content makes missing the CTA's easy = goal not efficiently accomplished</dd>
					</ul>
				
				<h3>Summarize what you understand to be the intent of the newly, redesigned site.<br>How will the previously identified goals be achieved?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>A redesign will address the inconsistent image sizes, the text styling, the layout, and highlight the CTA's better, most importantly, booking a visit. The intent is to give the site an exotic feel by incorporating subtle color tones playing down non-essential elements like a tiled background, organizing the many animal photographs into galleries that are separated from, but closely tied to, the rest of the content, use cartoony characters throughout the site to tie in the large header element and navigation, and draw more attention to the fundraising request.</li>
					</ul>
